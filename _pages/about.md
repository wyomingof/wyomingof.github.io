I am a second-year undergraduate computer science student at [Maseeh College of Engineering and Computer Science](https://www.pdx.edu/engineering/) within Portland State University.

My interests are at the intersection of embodied AI, robotics, and reinforcement learning. I admire the capabilities of current language models but think their real-world applications are limited by their interfaces. I'm passionate about developing systems that can more effectively interact with and assist us in the physical world.

Outside of school my 3 favourite things to read about are probably space, physics, and new tech - and also video games.
