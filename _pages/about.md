I am a second-year undergraduate computer science student at [Maseeh College of Engineering and Computer Science](https://www.pdx.edu/engineering/) within Portland State University.

My interests broadly span the intersection of embodied AI, robotics, and reinforcement learning. I think current language models are remarkable achievements but are limited by their interfaces. I am passionate about creating systems which can truly interact with and assist us in the physical world.
